Hi. My name is Moazzem. I am a budding machine learning & computer vision researcher. My main research interests lie at the intersection of Bayesian deep learning, approximate inference, and probabilistic models with intractable likelihoods.

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at University of Hyogo in Hyogo,Japan working with Prof. Syoji Kobashi and Dr. Saadia Binte Alam.

Prior to that, I studied computer science at International University of Business Agriculture & Technology in Bangladesh, where I had a major emphasis on algorithm design and analysis, theoretical computer science, programming language theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and a minor emphasis on mathematics and statistics. I graduated with first-class honours in 2018.
